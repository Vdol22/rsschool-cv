## About Me
> #### Get busy living or get busy dying.

I am 26 and am a graduate of two universities. Both have nothing to do with coding or programming. For the past 4 years, I've been working at an iron and steel plant. Nowadays, my position is "the head of the steelmaking laboratory". Recently, I was struck with a revelation that either I change my life and career completely, or go insane due to my current state of affairs.

My strongest desire was always to be able to work from any place in the world and thus travel as much as I physically can. Hence, I decided to learn web development and enter the IT sphere as a competent front-end specialist. I look forward to gain lots of knowledge and practical skills in the next year or two and hopefully begin a new career with a much brighter future than the black smoke which I see erupting from the pipes of the steel plant I currently struggle to work at.
